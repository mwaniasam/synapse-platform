echo "Attempting to fix font-related build errors..."

# This script is a placeholder for potential font-related fixes.
# Common issues include:
# 1. Missing font files or incorrect paths.
# 2. Incorrect font declarations in CSS.
# 3. Issues with Next.js font optimization.

# If you are using @next/font, ensure you have correctly configured it.
# Example:
# import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
# const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
# Then apply to body: <body className={inter.className}>

# If you are using custom fonts, ensure they are in the `public/fonts` directory
# and correctly referenced in `globals.css`.

echo "No specific font errors detected by this script. If you are still facing font issues,"
echo "please manually verify your font imports and declarations in `app/layout.tsx` and `app/globals.css`."
echo "Consider clearing your Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next` and then `npm run dev`."
